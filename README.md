Flyer is a Social Network Langing project. In here, users can paste their social network links as well as uploading files such as their resume or portfolio to be shared with other people (e.g., employers). A similar project would be linktree. The purpose of doing this project was to enter social media landing market and compete with other simlar companies providing such services.

This repository contains the front-end of the project, only.
